Only problem for New Zealand is that Martin is keeping up to the stumps, and the ball goes straight out again. The next is a thicker edge, past the keeper for four! Unlucky for Jess Kerr at the end.

Gardner tries to pull her next ball, though it was only on a length. Doesn’t get much, and duffs it on the dribble out to deep midwicket for one run. Two dot balls to Lanning, one angling into middle stump, one just outside off but edged into the ground. The last ball slips wider and Lanning can drive square. Three singles from the over, another good one from Kerr the Elder but cricketing junior. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-606039a88f08774d1beac487\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-28T08:09:57.105Z\">9.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>7th over: Australia 34-3 (Lanning 20, Gardner 5) </strong>Back to seam-up bowling as Sophie Devine bowls an over.

At least, not with the field up. The last over of the fielding restrictions and Lanning wants to take advantage.

Haynes c Devine b J. Kerr 3, Australia 14-3</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another one down, the vice-captain this time. Jess Kerr has been bowling a touch short to the left-hander with a deep square leg out. The first such delivery was pulled out there for a single. The second, Haynes tries to really muscle a similar shot, and plays under it. A top edge that lobs to mid on.

What a start for New Zealand. They’ve got Australia’s engine room in operation earlier than is customary: Lanning and Haynes. It’s one thing to get them in though; you’ve got to get them out as well to win. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-606034a38f08774d1beac474\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-28T07:50:16.452Z\">8.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">WICKET! Mooney c Mackay b J. Kerr 0 (1), Australia 3-2</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Mooney goes first ball! It’s the other Kerr, Jess, the sister of, who bowls with some swing away from the left-hander and some bounce. Mooney cuts and gets a thick top edge. And you <strong>cannot keep Frankie Mackay out of the game. </strong>There she is at first slip, taking the catch, hurling the ball up in the air with a look of pure disbelief on her face. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-606034268f08aff75c03d49a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-28T07:47:43.053Z\">8.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>1st over: Australia 3-0 (Mooney 3) </strong>Quite the tactical move from New Zealand. Frankie Mackay is an off-spinner and she opens the bowling. Her first of the over is a wide, drifting down the leg side. But she finds some grip and turn, spinning the ball back into Healy. One wider ball gets driven over cover, but well saved by Devine on the rope after a chase. And the wide is important, because it gives Mackay a seventh ball. That’s the one that provides the catch to Satterthwaite diving forward to take it low. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-606033968f08ef6f2f14215b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-28T07:45:38.235Z\">8.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">WICKET! Healy c Satterthwaite b Mackay 2 (6), Australia 3-1</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A wicket in the first over, and it’s Australia’s cleanest striker of the ball. Dream start for New Zealand. Gives herself room, opens the blade, and strikes Mackay straight to point. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-606032b18f08aff75c03d495\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-28T07:41:56.169Z\">8.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Australia must chase 131 to win</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>That’s that, then. Australia won’t be worried about 131, but at least NZ managed to get the ask up above a run a ball, and give themselves something to defend. Kerr will be key given the role Wareham and Jonassen played. The left-arm spinner took 3 for 26, and it was 3 for 14 before her final over when Green got a couple of belated hits away. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-606030438f08aff75c03d491\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-28T07:39:18.263Z\">8.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>20th over: NZ 130-6 (Halliday 11, Mackay 3) </strong>Some late entertainment from Frankie Mackay. Tall, strong, dreadlocks cascading out the back of her batting helmet, she walks out to the middle jumping and jigging, then tries an elaborate reverse sweep against Schutt first ball. Misses it, but sufficiently distracts Alyssa Healy that the keeper misses it too. The ball goes down the leg side but isn’t a wide because the batter played a reverse. It does however go down to the boundary for four byes. Next ball, she tries a lap shot through fine leg, misses that, and is given out lbw. Except she refers the decision and it shows there was a big inside edge, so she didn’t quite miss it. She doesn’t get the run that she should have got though, given the Laws say the ball becomes dead once the umpire’s finger goes up. She finally belts her first run off the bat to deep midwicket, then gets the strike back for the final ball, and helicopters it away through square leg for two. Should be run out by metres, but Wareham’s throw goes awry and Healy has to undertake a pilgrimage to collect the ball. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60602fb58f08ef6f2f142150\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-28T07:28:21.517Z\">8.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">WICKET! Green b Schutt 15 (11), NZ 122-6</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Luck for Schutt, as Green steps way outside leg stump. Schutt follows her feet, aiming in at the boots, and it hits Green’s pad and ricochets back at an angle so sharp that the ball hits off stump. First ball of the final over, Schutt removes the danger striker. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60602ef18f08774d1beac45e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-28T07:26:40.743Z\">8.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>19th over: NZ 122-5 (Green 15, Halliday 10) </strong>Jonassen to close out the innings at one end, but <strong>Maddy Green smacks her for six!</strong> Dead straight down the ground after a charge. Simple. Next ball, predictably, Jonassen bowls a bit shorter, and Green stays back to <strong>place the late cut for four. </strong>Splits the two fielders behind point. Jonassen switches to left-arm over the wicket to the right-hander, and it works as a ball spins sharply from outside leg stump and evades the bat, hitting the thigh pad. Leg bye and it gets Green off strike. A couple of singles follow, then JJ yorks Halliday off the last ball, no score as it jams between toe and turf. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60602e098f08774d1beac45b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-28T07:23:14.977Z\">8.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>18th over: NZ 109-5 (Green 4, Halliday 9)</strong> Schutt to bowl two of the last three overs, as per usual. The batters trade singles from the first three balls, then Brooke Halliday advances, opening the face a touch, and lofts a drive over mid off for four! Top shot. She debuted earlier this summer for New Zealand. Places the fifth ball nicely along the ground through midwicket, Green racing back in good support to create the second run, then the left-handed Halliday walks outside leg stump and goes up and over square leg for two more. A good over for NZ! They score 11. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60602d668f08aff75c03d489\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-28T07:17:55.416Z\">8.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>17th over: NZ 98-5 (Green 2, Halliday 0) </strong>Wareham finishes her night with <strong>1 for 18</strong> from her four overs.

Gets a thick sliced edge high over backward point, and Haynes backpedals and gets hands above her head to take a very good catch. Kerr couldn’t get any fluency tonight.

I’ve got Grant Elliott on my commentary stream doing his best Kevin Pietersen impression. Took a while to work out who the actual speaker was. A couple of singles, then Satterthwaite <strong>hits the first six of the night. </strong>Length from Carey, the batter dips her knees enough to get under it and lifts it over deep square leg with a cross-bat swing. Tries again and gets the toe of the bat, past off stump and past the keeper for two. Tries a third time from the last ball of the over, looking to midwicket, slices it straighter than that, and Perry at long on is one of the best outfield catchers in the game. <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-03-28T07:14:11.127Z\">at 8.14am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60602a338f08ef6f2f142134\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-28T07:04:36.849Z\">8.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>14th over: NZ 79-2 (Satterthwaite 27, Kerr 17)</strong> Wareham keeps hanging the ball up there, and Kerr keeps going for it without really getting it.

Right-armer to the left-hander, angling across Satterthwaite at pace, and hitting a hard length at 120+. Three times Satterthwaite tries to swing to the leg side, without much of an indication of what she was hoping to do. Fourth ball she decides to change the length by charging, and <strong>slams a cross-bat shot past mid off for four.</strong> Got the better on that occasion. But Vlaeminck has her number with the fifth ball. Again Satterthwaite hangs back and swings across the line.

I’m all for inventive thinking in cricket, but anyone who has watched her bat knows that Hayley Jensen is not an opener. That’s a horrible shot. A short ball that really she could hit to a range of spots. Jensen is in three minds. Leaning onto the front foot, then trying to shift onto the back foot, she gets stuck in between. Ends up playing the ball with one foot off the ground. It’s outside the line of her body, and yet she’s trying to heave to the leg side. It’s a horrible mix, and it only sends the ball 10 metres straight up in the air, for the wicketkeeper to trot around and catch. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-606022a98f08774d1beac40c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-28T06:33:00.507Z\">7.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">WICKET!

Devine gets one boundary away off Jonassen, skipping down to hit the spinner down the ground. But she tries to go again in the same over, a slog-sweep this time.

Oversteps while bowling the fourth ball and concedes a no-ball. Gets away with the free hit, because Devine steps away to give herself room, anticipating a bouncer, but instead gets a high fast full toss at her body. Just low enough to be a legal delivery, and Devine can only edge it into the ground to the keeper. Then Vlaeminck errs leg side for a couple of wides, way outside off stump for a cut shot to the boundary from Jensen, then leg side again for a glance to the fine-leg rope. No runs from her first over, 12 from her second. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60601f538f08774d1beac3f1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-28T06:18:58.890Z\">7.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>2nd over: NZ 9-0 (Devine 8, Jensen 1)</strong> Megan Schutt will be the new-ball partner, her inswinging style from over the wicket, right arm. She pins down Jensen for three balls, then draws an outside edge that falls short of backward point. But Jensen pinches a single, and that gives Devine a chance. She’s played a lot of cricket with Megan Schutt at the Adelaide Strikers in the WBBL, and takes her on, first ball. Smacks it over mid on for four, with the field up. Streaky stroke, across the line, but the next one isn’t. Schutt overpitches, and Devine hits <strong>dead straight</strong> over the bowler for four. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60601de68f08aff75c03d40c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-28T06:16:39.908Z\">7.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>1st over: NZ 0-0 (Devine 0, Jensen 0) </strong>It will be Tayla Vlaeminck to start for Australia, a new-ish young pace bowler who was the quickest in the world before a foot injury that cost her a spot in last year’s T20 World Cup. This is her first match back in national colours in over a year. And <strong>she’s lost no pace with the layoff!</strong> Starts at 119 kph, and soon works her way up to 122 and 123 as she launches at Sophie Devine. Most seam bowlers in the women’s game operate more between 100 and 115. Vlaeminck stays back of a length and straight or outside off stump. Beats a couple of cross-batted shots from Devine, and has her ducking a ball at the body that doesn’t get up too high in the end, but Devine gets under it.

The game of the bat and the ball has been everywhere of late. The New Zealand men’s team had a frolic against Bangladesh earlier today in a 20-over match. The England men’s team will tackle India across 50 overs in a match starting two hours after this one. But here, we’ve got the Australian women being hosted by New Zealand in the first of three T20 Internationals, followed by three One-Day Internationals. </p> <p>This time of year was roughly when the 50-over Women’s World Cup was due to be held in New Zealand, but it got postponed. The Australian team hasn’t played since hosting the Kiwis last September and early October, although the players have been busy domestically. Everyone in this squad missed the last few rounds of the domestic 50-over comp, the Women’s National Cricket League, and in the absence of some star players from both sides, Queensland won the Ruth Preddy Cup for the first time over the weekend, beating Victoria. </p> <p>As for New Zealand, they had a home series across both white-ball formats against England, and got thumped resoundingly. They’re a team at a dead end at the moment, unable to generate much on-field energy in the last few years, especially once they reach global tournaments. Given they’ll be hosting the big one less than a year from now, they need to break out of that lethargy. <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-03-28T06:29:50.767Z\">at 7.29am BST</time></p>  </div>",

          "body": "<p>The British-Nigerian artist <a href=\"http://yinkashonibare.com/\">Yinka Shonibare</a> makes work – often in sculpture, painting and tapestry – that looks unflinchingly at race, class and colonialism. The 58-year-old, who is partly paralysed after contracting a virus of the spine in his late teens, was one of the original<strong> </strong>YBAs and was shortlisted for the Turner prize in 2004. His 2010 sculpture <em><a href=\"https://www.rmg.co.uk/national-maritime-museum/attractions/nelsons-ship-bottle\">Nelson’s Ship in a Bottle</a></em>, a scaled-down replica of HMS Victory with sails made from his signature batik fabric, was one of the most memorable artworks on Trafalgar Square’s fourth plinth and now has a permanent home outside the Maritime Museum in Greenwich. Shonibare was recently given the 2021 Art Icon award by the Whitechapel Gallery.</p> <p><strong>Congratulations on becoming the Whitechapel’s</strong> <strong>eighth</strong><strong> Art Icon. You join a storied list of artists, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/mar/09/howard-hodgkin-farewell-master-of-colour-artist-modern-turner\">Howard Hodgkin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/whiteread\">Rachel Whiteread</a>…<br></strong>I’ve been a fan of that gallery for a long time, so I feel particularly honoured. I didn’t even know that anyone noticed what I did!</p> <p><strong>Part of the award was an auction of artwork that raised funds for the Whitechapel’s education and community projects. How worried are you about museums and galleries surviving the Covid period?<br></strong>Oh gosh, under lockdown we can see the state of all of our minds when we don’t have that input from culture. You don’t actually realise the importance of those things until they get taken away suddenly. I’ve had most of my education within museums and galleries: intellectually, socially, spiritually, everything. Art for art’s sake actually is extremely important for human survival.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Picasso appropriated from another culture and I appropriate from European ethic art</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>You have a new show, opening in London in June, based on Picasso’s collection of African art. Can you explain?<br></strong>It’s called African Spirits of Modernism and the work is in the form of sculpture, quilts and also slide projections. I knew that Picasso was influenced by African art. But I didn’t know that he had a huge collection of African art. If I remember correctly, it might have been Matisse who introduced him to it. And he was completely obsessed by the power of those objects and the spirituality behind them. But ironically, of course, Picasso is far better known for African art than the Africans themselves.</p> <p><strong>So it’s work inspired by Picasso, who in turn was inspired by African art and sculpture?<br></strong>In a way. In the show, I’ve also appropriated classical western sculptures, but then I kind of hybridise them with African heads. Picasso was interested in appropriating from another culture and I also appropriate from European ethnic art. The world is a free place: we can be inspired by one another and critique one another. So it’s a fun show, colourful, but there are all those serious things about power and the relationship between Africa and Europe.</p> <p><strong>You also have a survey exhibition, <a href=\"https://www.museumdermoderne.at/en/exhibitions-events/detail/yinka-shonibare-cbe-end-of-empire-3/\">End of Empire</a>, opening in </strong><strong>Salzburg</strong><strong>’s </strong><strong>Museum der Moderne</strong><strong> in </strong><strong>May</strong><strong>. You don’t want to call it a “retrospective” – why not?<br></strong>Because I’m a spring chicken. I’m only 58. So why should I have a retrospective? That’s what they do for dead people.</p> <p><strong>It’s 60 works collected from the past 30 years. Do you still feel connected to the work you made early in your career?<br></strong>Oh, absolutely. I wish actually the world had changed dramatically since I started out, but it hasn’t, unfortunately. So we need to keep pushing. Keep being visible, keep making and raising issues.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c708ce668672e6ecb7b5bc79c7645bc895cc3aba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c708ce668672e6ecb7b5bc79c7645bc895cc3aba/0_34_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yinka Shonibare’s Nelson’s Ship in a Bottle on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square in 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘It doesn’t scare the public too much’: Yinka Shonibare’s Nelson’s Ship in a Bottle on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Would you say you are best known for </strong><em><strong>Nelson’s Ship in a Bottle</strong></em><strong>?<br></strong>Possibly, but I’m quite happy with that. It’s a playful piece and it’s a very important subject, but the public feel easy with that work. They get it after a while; it doesn’t scare them too much.</p> <p><strong>It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/jan/05/yinka-shonibare-to-create-leeds-memorial-for-nigerian-david-oluwale-police-harassment-1960s\">recently announced</a> that you are making a sculpture in Leeds to honour </strong><strong>David Oluwale</strong><strong>, who died in </strong><strong>1969</strong><strong> after persistent harassment by the police. You’ve said you want the work to be “hopeful” – why is that important?<br></strong>Like George Floyd, what happened to David Oluwale was a tragic thing to have happened through police harassment at the time. But you don’t want the next generation to be full of hate. You want people to start looking at the better side of human nature, rather than thinking that’s what the world is like. So you don’t want to perpetuate tragedy. You want people to feel they can be hopeful. And people can be better than that.</p> <p><strong>How has your way of working changed during the pandemic?<br></strong>I don’t think it’s actually changed a lot. About 10 years ago, I decided that I had to have more life-work balance. I used to go into the studio every single day and work all hours. So I changed it to Monday, Wednesday, Friday and I found that I became maybe four times more productive.</p> <p><strong>What do you do with the new time for “life” you created?<br></strong>I try to look after myself a bit more. I have a physiotherapist, I do my physio. And you’ve got to make time for personal relationships, too, otherwise you’re not going to be a happy person in the end. Yeah, you might make a lot of money, but you won’t be happy.</p> <p><strong>You have had a very productive pandemic. What do you put that down to?<br></strong>I’m very fortunate that my job is also my lifestyle. So I don’t think about my art as work. In a way, it is therapy. And for people who are fortunate enough to be creative, I think the pandemic hasn’t been as devastating mentally. Because you can escape into that space, work there and thrive there. I feel fortunate that anyone wants the results of my creativity. I’d probably be one of those eccentrics who just produce these things anyway. But fortunately there is such a profession as artist, so people<strong> </strong>can take it off my hands.</p> <p><em>For more information on the Art Icon award</em><em>, supported by the Swarovski Foundation,</em><em> visit <a href=\"https://www.whitechapelgallery.org/\">whitechapelgallery.org</a>. </em><em>African Spirits of Modernism</em><em> opens at the <a href=\"https://www.stephenfriedman.com/exhibitions/\">Stephen Friedman Gallery</a> in London on </em><em>4 June</em></p>",

Apart from anything else, it would save so much police <em>time</em>, which could be more happily spent chasing down hate crime/catching the sod who pinched my bike/insert culture war prejudice here.</p> <p>Welcome again to <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p00yzlr0/line-of-duty?seriesId=m000tjg9\">Line of Duty</a></strong>, which wouldn’t in truth be itself without all Mercurio’s acronyms and a tense final interrogation or two and remains, despite its own parody-eager self, one of the precious metals on British TV. We find ourselves in this most recent outing with Kate having left AC-12 (<em>ish)</em>, and Steve buying codeine-infused ibuprofen – didn’t even know you could get that, hurrah! – either to cope with back pain and old gun wounds or in the mistaken belief it might help him get rid of that weirdy beard. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/mar/06/kelly-macdonald-line-of-duty\">Kelly Macdonald</a>, following in the hard-to-fill boot-steps of Lennie James, Keeley Hawes and Thandie Newton as the high-flying cop under staunch scrutiny over just what corners they are cutting to fly so high.</p> <p>I have hopes for Macdonald as the most intriguing villain yet. The acting, the facial hints of a double, if not triple, life, subtle, that ageless face able to morph from tender to slab-cold cruel within an eyebrow. The intrigue is in the voice, which always sounds like a wee Kelvinside lassie trying to plead for puppies’ welfare, and, as a brutal betrayer, cannot be bettered. Also, we got tantalising glimpses of the great Andi Osho as the murdered journalist, a magazine spread on whom featured the pull quote: “I believe that journalists should write only what they hold in their heart to be true.” Pretty much the diametric opposite of all I’ve been taught in my 165 years of journalism, which was to report what really happened and what people really said, and so I anticipate later flashbacks.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Watch this, revel in its truths, and you’ll never again dismiss anyone’s claims with 'those were different times'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Adrian Dunbar kept his engagement low in this opener but, as ever, came up with the finest line. “Houl yer whisht” – or “haud yir wheest”, as the Scots have it – sounds so much better, might you agree, than the sour English of “shut your face”? Whatever, <em>Line of Duty</em> MkVI will keep us going for seven weeks until we are free, free, free, I tell you.</p> <p>The most remarkable documentary this year so far had me in tears at times. I had thought, when first encountering a programme about kickball and child abuse, that I might spend a more enjoyable three hours repeatedly slamming my fingers in the car door. As it turned out, it just goes to show how a flawlessly researched programme, three years in Daniel Gordon’s making and faultlessly unprejudicial, unsensational, can enlighten and change minds.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000ths2/footballs-darkest-secret-series-1-1-the-end-of-silence\">Football’s Darkest Secret</a></strong> was the tawdry tale of 70s and 80s teen abuse within certain football clubs: but, so much more, it was an insight into how many family lives cleaved to the game in those days, often joyously. And, hence, how much more calamitous the fallout when the coach was revealed as a predatory paedophile.</p> <p>I can’t stress enough the fallout. It’s not only the victim, the 14-year-old lad eager to play football yet equally eager to please and in thrall to the coach. It’s the parents, who, when the shock of revelation hits, find themselves ostracised: “How could you have let that happen, you must have known?” It’s the children of the victims, denied chances to be free to, say, play football. Chiefly, though, it’s the victims – haunted throughout their subsequent lives by guilt, unspecified anger, occasionally irrational homophobia, sometimes a wander into drink and drugs and suicide, but constantly a teen memory of someone putting, unsought, his penis inside you or forcing your hands on to his genitals.</p> <p>This was about a tiny subsection of society – young men in training with junior football clubs. And the likes of Barry Bennell, George Ormond and Frank Roper must, by rough calculation, have affected the lives not just of those they abused but an entire subsequent hinterland of hundreds, if not thousands. Watch this, take in its truths, as exposed by former <em>Guardian</em> and <em>Observer</em> journalist Daniel Taylor and Victoria Derbyshire and, crucially, the phenomenally brave victims Andy Woodward and Ian Ackley, among others, and you’ll never again dismiss anyone’s claims with “those were different times”. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a8ed25af759ef3072359727f1ce8bd552e791c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a8ed25af759ef3072359727f1ce8bd552e791c7/62_0_1875_1126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Linton Kwesi Johnson in the ‘softly angry, sometimes lyrical’ Black Power\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Linton Kwesi Johnson in the ‘softly angry, sometimes lyrical’ Black Power.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Rogan Productions Limited</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What a gift must have been the existence of Michael X to the white establishment in 60s Britain!

Michael X, hanged in Trinidad for two murders, was, according to ex-British Black Panther Farrukh Dhondy, “slightly mad. Michael X made the biggest noise of all and had the least effect on any progress in the lives of black people in Britain.” This timely programme should, 50 years on, have two effects.

          "body": "<p>Senior Labour MPs want Keir Starmer to bring in a “big figure” to provide greater direction to his leadership, amid concerns within the party that caution and a lack of ambition are holding back his performance.</p> <p>Shadow cabinet ministers are understood to be among those who have concerns that Starmer is losing crucial momentum at the end of his first year in office, with several MPs calling for more experience to be injected into his team to spell out “what Keir is for”. It comes as the Conservatives are still enjoying a lead in the polls, with several pollsters suggesting that a “vaccine bounce” has also helped Boris Johnson repair some of his personal approval rating in the wake of major mistakes in his handling of Covid last year.</p> <p>Short-term annoyances in the run-up to the budget, during which Labour <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/feb/24/keir-starmer-corporation-tax-rise-labour-budget\" title=\"\">contrived to have a row</a> over its own position on corporation tax, and shadow business secretary Ed Miliband <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/24/labour-to-outline-plan-to-spark-electric-car-revolution-across-uk\" title=\"\">backed electric cars</a> while conceding he did not own one, have fed into frustrations that have been building over recent months. The emergence of wider unease follows Peter Mandelson’s call for Starmer to begin a review of the party’s policies, in order to adopt measures that are “radical, credible, affordable”.</p> <p>There has also been concern that the party’s main message for the local elections so far has focused on NHS workers’ pay, with some worrying that it may soon be undermined by a higher government pay offer, or that it fails to appeal to other public and private sector workers hit hard by the pandemic. “People do underestimate the mountain of shit Keir inherited,” said one senior MP. “It is a monumental task. But there is a complaint of a lack of grip.”</p> <p>Another said: “There is deep frustration in the shadow cabinet over a lack of direction.”</p> <p>While there is widespread acknowledgement in the party that Starmer faced a major challenge after taking power following years of party infighting, concerns have begun to focus on former MP Jenny Chapman, his director of politics, and Morgan McSweeney, his chief of staff. MPs complain of being ignored and that there is no sense of a “shared political project”.</p> <p>Some called for more experience to be brought into Starmer’s team. A shadow minister said: “The problem is that Keir’s team is very inexperienced. We are in a bit of a state. They have spent too much time over the last year trying to appease the hard left on one hand and being too cautious trying to look like a government in waiting. There is lots of concern in the PLP about Keir’s office in general.”</p> <p>Another MP said the impetus should come from the leader himself. “Keir is the leader of the Labour party, he doesn’t need a crutch to lean on, he just needs to get out there and lead. He is the big figure.”</p> <p>Allies of Chapman and McSweeney say critics have seriously underestimated the work they had done to “save the Labour party” since Starmer took office. They have spearheaded an overhaul of the party’s structures in the wake of the factional fighting that took place under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership.</p> <p>Sources said they had been flat out during Starmer’s first year, securing a new general secretary, shoring up Starmer’s support on the party’s ruling national executive committee and trying to improve Labour’s organisation in Scotland, where it now has a new leader. “It might be subtle what they do, but they are ruthlessly effective,” said a party source. “An incredibly important part of our strategy has had to be fixing the party.”</p> <p>Ultimately, figures close to Starmer said, the public was understandably focused on the vaccine drive, making it a bad time to make judgments about Labour’s performance. The details of Labour’s local election campaign are being overseen by deputy leader Angela Rayner and two experienced Labour campaigners, Simon Fletcher and Anneliese Midgley.</p> <p>With Starmer’s first anniversary as leader just a week away, however, some are concerned that early impressions matter – and are difficult to change. “Politics is all about momentum,” said a Labour frontbencher. “If you’re too cautious then the wind leaves your sails, and it can sometimes be very difficult to get it to blow again.”</p>",

“obvious systemic factors” during packaging after use of the vaccine was suspended in the city and neighbouring Macau this week.<br><br>Reuters: Authorities on Wednesday halted the use of a Covid vaccine developed by BioNTech citing defective packaging, triggering confusion in inoculation centres across the city.<br><br>The suspension came as the Asian financial hub has faced a sluggish take-up of vaccines due to dwindling confidence in China’s Sinovac vaccine and fears of adverse reactions.</p> <p>In a statement published late on Saturday, the city’s government said the investigation results did not rule out that the situation was “caused by environmental conditions during the long-haul transport process.”<br><br>It was not related to the cold-chain and logistical management of the vaccine and random testing of intact vials delivered to Hong Kong did not uncover any issue of leakage, it said.<br><br>Both Fosun and BioNTech considered the vaccines to have no safety risks and people who have received them “do not need to worry”, the government said.<br><br>The remaining part of the investigation will focus on “ascertaining the integrity of the intrinsic properties of the relevant batches of vaccine, and that the batches are safe for use.”<br><br>The government said it was following up with Fosun and BioNTech to complete the investigation within a week to allow for a resumption of supplying the vaccines to the public.<br><br>The city started vaccinating residents with doses from Sinovac in February and began offering the one developed by BioNTech in March.<br><br>The BioNTech vaccine is distributed in Hong Kong and Macau via a partnership with China’s Fosun Pharma, while BioNTech partners with Pfizer in markets outside greater China.

Some momentous highs and chastening lows along the way; tours that won’t be forgotten, not least due to the bio-bubbles they have been played in, and the rest-and-rotation policy that’s necessitated. <br></p> <p>But if they can get up today in this third one-dayer, Jos Buttler’s understaffed side will leave the subcontinent with a trophy in the hand luggage and their number one ranking secured in the format. All told, not a bad effort after taking after taking the T20 series to a decider last week - especially after the last three Tests.</p> <p>It’s hard to imagine Mark Wood won’t return after resting in Friday’s frenetic victory, Tom Curran the man most likely to make way in that scenario. It’s not entirely whether Sam Billings will be fit enough to play, but if he does, England will need to pick between the battle-hardened Dawid Malan and excitement machine Liam Livingstone, the latter doing his reputation no harm when twice boshing Bhuvneshwar over the rope to seal the deal on debut. </p> <p>As for India, the main decision they have to make is whether they shake up their spin ranks after Krunal Pandya and Kuldeep Yadav went for a combined 0/156 from 16 overs on game two. In fairness, they ran head first into Jonny Bairstow and Ben Stokes, who weren’t yielding to anyone on a flat pitch in that kind of brutal form. <br></p> <p>When England were defeated in the opener, losing a couple of players to injury along the way - including captain Eoin Morgan - the message was clear: they weren’t going to change their tactics. Going after the bowling from the get-go had taken them to the top of the world and it would keep them there - something like that. It’s now India who have their gameplan under the microscope. Will they again go with their steady-as-she-goes build before exploding in the final ten overs? Something to think about as we near the toss.<br></p> <p>Strap yourselves in (or <a href=\"mailto:adam.collins.casual@theguardia.com\">drop me a line</a>): this promises to be a beauty. <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-03-28T07:08:02.581Z\">at 8.08am BST</time></p>  </div>",

Numbers started to increase again in the autumn, falling back briefly in November before reaching a record level in January 2021. Since then cases have declined sharply, though this fall has flattened out in March.

Meanwhile the over-60s have had an overall lower case rate, largely because they are more able to self-isolate.</p> \n<p>Under-20s have also had a relatively low case rate.

          "body": "<p>A more sceptical academic than Paul McKeigue might perhaps have wondered if the emails flooding into his inbox from “Ivan”, a purported Russian spy, were too good to be true.</p> <p>Ivan appeared to share many of McKeigue’s own personal obsessions, particularly his desire to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-56524550\" title=\"\">discredit investigators who compile evidence of war crimes</a> committed in Syria. And he claimed access to both ready cash and secret intelligence.</p> <p>The Edinburgh genetics professor – who devotes large quantities of his private time to pursuing fringe theories claiming that attacks on civilians are staged to smear the government of Bashar al-Assad – dived eagerly into his new correspondence.</p> <p>Over three months he filled hundreds of pages with speculation, including accusing journalists, researchers and diplomats of working as conduits for western intelligence agencies. He revealed the identity of a confidential source, and shared information she gave him.</p> <p>But McKeigue was not writing to a Russian spy, or even a man called Ivan. The email account was controlled by a group of staff at one of the organisations he hoped to discredit, who say they went undercover because of concerns over the tactics McKeigue and his allies were prepared to deploy in an effort to defend the Syrian government and its Russian allies.</p> <p>“We never thought it would go this far. He accepted the communication immediately without doing any checks,” said Nerma Jelacic, a former <em>Observer</em> journalist who now works at the Commission for International Justice and Accountability (CIJA) and played a key role in the sting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ce262b8aaf9b8b55e378a1d8d639c5b453e00a98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce262b8aaf9b8b55e378a1d8d639c5b453e00a98/18_6_386_482/386.jpg\" alt=\"Paul McKeigue\" width=\"386\" height=\"482\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul McKeigue</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Taken from web</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“In the end there were about 500 pages of email correspondence from 1 December until March,” she says, in her first full account of the action.</p> <p>The CIJA collects documentary evidence from Syria so that war criminals can be held legally responsible for atrocities. Its work has already been used in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/12/my-goal-is-justice-for-all-syrians-one-mans-journey-from-jail-to-witness-for-the-prosecution\" title=\"\">landmark trial in Germany</a>, the first time Syrian officials have faced charges of state-sponsored torture.</p> <p>It has also apparently riled McKeigue, who is preparing a report on the group with ideological allies, and was searching for information that could discredit the CIJA.</p> <p>“We knew they were turning their attention to us,” said Jelacic. “In part we wanted to see what security risk they might pose to people working for us in terms of what they might reveal.”</p> <p>They were stunned by both his willingness to engage with a purported Russian agent, and the information he shared.</p> <p>Among the most damaging claims McKeigue made was that a Russian diplomat at the Geneva embassy, first secretary Sergey Krutskikh, was corresponding with fellow members of the “Working Group on Syria, Propaganda and Media” on encrypted systems.</p> <p>This is an alliance of far-left academics and researchers who claim western journalists, NGOs and others act on behalf of the CIA and MI6 to undermine the Syrian government, including faking evidence of civilian deaths and chemical attacks.</p> <p>It includes the controversial Bristol University professor David Miller, who has been accused of antisemitism by his own students, a claim he denies, and the blogger Vanessa Beeley, who has frequently visited Syria on government-sponsored trips.</p> <p>Group members have questioned the veracity of chemical weapons attacks in Syria and claimed Russia was framed for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/23/skripal-salisbury-poisoning-decline-of-russia-spy-agencies-gru\" title=\"\">poisoning of Sergei Skripal</a> in Salisbury in 2018.</p> <p>They were also part of a years-long public campaign against the White Helmets, a civilian rescue organisation that enraged pro-Syrian and Russian factions by recording atrocities as they tried to save lives, then sharing the footage.</p> <p>The organisation’s founder, James Le Mesurier, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/oct/27/syria-disinformation-war-white-helmets-mayday-rescue-james-le-mesurier\" title=\"\">fell to his death in an apparent suicide in 2019</a> amid the intense public pressure, which included smears not just on the group’s work, but its finances and his personal life. The CIJA feared it might face a similar onslaught.</p> <p>“Why did we do it? We’d watched what had happened to James Le Mesurier,” Jelacic said. “We knew they would not just go after the organisation but the leader, Bill Wiley, and they would say: ‘He’s a spy. He’s corrupt.’”</p> <p>Over the course of the correspondence McKeigue fished for personal information about both Wiley and CIJA finances, after questions were raised about its accounting by the European Anti-fraud Office, Olaf. None of this has any bearing on the credibility of the archive it has collected, and the CIJA defends its financial management.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ecbd4de8886758bd7b0c0e03b8aede46f9191cd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecbd4de8886758bd7b0c0e03b8aede46f9191cd4/2003_1198_508_635/400.jpg\" alt=\"Nerma Jelacic.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nerma Jelacic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EPA/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“From what you now know about Wiley,” he asked Ivan in one email, “do you think it’s possible he has some kind of drugs problem (like cocaine)? This is just wild speculation on my part, but it might explain some of his irrational and unpredictable behaviour.”</p> <p>For Jelacic, who fled the former Yugoslavia as a teenager with her family during the war, the attempts by McKeigue and the Working Group to cast doubt on what is happening in Syria bring back memories of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/mar/15/pressandpublishing.tvnews\" title=\"\"> campaigns by the far left</a> to deny genocide in Bosnia.</p> <p>“What’s different is that it’s a level of disinformation not seen before. What’s worrying is that it’s tolerated,” she said.</p> <p>“Even in mainstream academic circles this disinformation and denial is being misrepresented as freedom of expression and speech… We have a moral duty to stand up to revision and denial.”</p> <p>McKeigue told the <em>Observer</em> that the sting had been a “clever deception operation”, and he might have used more “guarded language” had he known the exchanges would be made public. Asked about claims of contact with a Russian diplomat, he declined to comment directly, except to hint he might have exaggerated in some exchanges.</p> <p>“The people on the other end of this sting managed to get me to reveal information provided by others that was not intended to be shared, along with other information that may have been embellished,” he said. “This was a failure on my part for which I accept responsibility and have apologised to those concerned.”</p> <p>The professor has also denied doing anything wrong or illegal, saying that he kept an open mind about who he was communicating with.</p> <p>In its own statement Edinburgh University told the <em>Observer</em>: “The actions referred to in media reports were undertaken in Paul McKeigue’s capacity as a private citizen, not as an employee of the university. We respect the rights of staff to have interests unrelated to their roles within the institution. However, if we receive complaints about anyone’s conduct which we consider damages our reputation, then we will consider whether an investigation is required and take appropriate action.”</p>",

As the numbers of people receiving their first dose ticked into the millions, volunteers at vaccination clinics were next in line.</p> <p>But now they have all been jabbed, vaccinators are turning to police officers, firefighters, taxi drivers, teachers, supermarket staff and family and friends – anyone who can be contacted easily and is free to hotfoot it to the clinic at a few minutes’ notice.</p> <p>The alternative would be unthinkable – throwing away perfectly usable vaccine doses when millions of people are still at risk of catching Covid and passing it on.</p> <p>Yet that practice has been both praised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/04/concerns-raised-over-queue-jumping-as-phe-workers-given-covid-vaccine\" title=\"\">and criticised</a> by political leaders and senior NHS figures, and now a strange code of <em>omertà</em> hangs over the vaccine programme.</p> <p>“You can’t use my name,” one GP told the <em>Observer</em>, “or which city I am in. If you do, we will all get an email telling us that we shouldn’t be doing it. But we are also not allowed to waste vaccines.”</p> <p>“There’s no official guidance,” another said. “Just do not waste vaccine. We just have to do what is sensible. It was fairly easy at the beginning when we were focusing on the over-70s, and you’ve got some 55-year-olds. You think ‘well, they’re going to be done in two weeks’ time anyway’.</p> <p>“But as you start going down the list, it starts getting controversial. And now that we’re doing the first nine categories, the next people are the under-50s.”</p> <p>The cohorts were drawn up by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation which set priorities based on age and vulnerability. Everyone in the first nine cohorts – and anyone 50 or over – should have been offered a jab by the end of March.</p> <p>Leftovers are an inevitable consequence of a high-speed mass vaccination campaign. When 350 people are booked into a clinic at a few days’ notice, some do not show up.</p> <p>But the Pfizer vaccine lasts for three days once defrosted, and both it and the AstraZeneca vaccine have use-by dates. And the vaccine vials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/17/pfizer-vaccine-fda-says-extra-doses-in-vials-can-be-used-potentially-expanding-us-supply\" title=\"\">usually contain extra doses</a>. “Pfizer is meant to have five, but we get six,” one of the GPs said. “The AstraZeneca 10-dose vials can give you 13.”</p> <p>She described the clinic as a juggling act: “At the end, you work out how many doses you’ve got left – hopefully no more than one or two. All the people you’ve booked should be in cohorts one to nine. So then you start looking for someone else.”</p> <p>“There have been calls to fire stations for anyone off-duty,” one NHS source said. “Carers bringing their 80-year-old mother to get her jab. Taxi drivers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e0067563077f68e5390d09d073b8ee122a7c8da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e0067563077f68e5390d09d073b8ee122a7c8da/0_44_2929_1758/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vaccine vials usually contain extra doses.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vaccine vials usually contain extra doses.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christophe Archambault/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“On days when it’s been a bit quiet, they have been unofficially reaching out to headmasters of local schools,” a volunteer at a vaccination clinic in London said. “Teachers coming in, policemen and women – people on frontline services, people who most of us believe should be getting it anyway.”</p> <p>“We try not to pull people off the street,” said one GP who runs a vaccination centre. “That’s no way to run a clinic. But our lead marshal does have the number of a local police station, and we’ve also had contact from a local secondary school saying ‘our staff would be very keen to be vaccinated’.”</p> <p>Both Labour and the vaccine minister Nadim Zahawi had said in February that they believed key workers should be given priority for vaccinations, but the JCVI guidance issued later that month did not give them any special status on the basis that most key workers did not have a higher risk of contracting Covid due to their profession.</p> <p>Some clinics have ended up throwing away supplies. A woman in her 30s told the <em>Observer</em> how she had been turned away after a friend working at a clinic in East Anglia said that they needed to find people for five leftover Pfizer doses. “When I got there I said, quite straightforwardly, that I’d been told there were some doses left over. The woman looked at me and said ‘how’s that going to look on social media?’ It was as if it was quite unethical for me to even be there.</p> <p>“But afterwards my friend told me those five doses were wasted. I completely understand that I’m not in a high priority group. I wouldn’t want to push my way in front of anybody. But I do think I’m worth more than a bin.”</p> <p>NHS England told GPs in January to draw up reserve lists of patients who could attend clinics at short notice, and there has been remarkably little wastage. A freedom of information request revealed that of 156,262 Pfizer doses used before 8 January, only 1,055 shots were wasted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/17/pfizer-vaccine-fda-says-extra-doses-in-vials-can-be-used-potentially-expanding-us-supply\">Pfizer vaccine: FDA says extra doses in vials can be used, potentially expanding US supply</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/25/uk-diplomacy-masks-private-fury-in-covid-vaccine-row-with-eu\" title=\"\">restriction on supplies of AstraZeneca</a> vaccine in April and no permission yet to go beyond cohort nine, GPs are now wondering how to deal with further leftover doses.</p> <p>“We’re not allowed to go into cohort 10,” GP running a vaccination centre said. “We have actually had to stop running clinics.

          "body": "<p>When Priti Patel stood up in parliament last week to unveil her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/mar/23/migrants-entering-uk-illegally-to-be-liable-for-removal-at-any-time\" title=\"\">plans to overhaul the asylum system</a>, she told us she was making all this effort not for votes, not to keep out foreigners, not to appease nationalists… but for women. With a plaintive tone, she observed that those we see in small boats out on the Channel are so often men and asked: “Where are the vulnerable women and children that this system should exist to protect?”</p> <p>If the home secretary really wants to find them, I can introduce her to some of these women. Indeed, I could take her this week to meet a woman I know very well – I’ll call her Gloria. Gloria comes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the government persecutes dissidents with impunity. Gloria was involved in opposition politics. One night, soldiers came to her home, gang-raped her and took her to prison. After some time, a prison guard gave her to a stranger who said that he would help her.</p> <p>But this was not the escape she longed for. The man took her on to an aeroplane under a false passport. They ended up in London where, without papers, without friends, without money, she was locked in his flat and forced to have sex with other men. Eventually, a cleaner helped her to escape and Gloria presented herself to the Home Office.</p> <p>Traumatised, and physically and mentally exhausted, Gloria was unable to express everything that had happened to her. Because she didn’t yet feel safe, she couldn’t even speak about how she had been brought into the country. So she was at first refused refugee status and locked up at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/dec/16/home-office-criticised-over-plan-to-house-asylum-seekers-at-yarls-wood\" title=\"\">Yarl’s Wood</a>, Bedfordshire. Just recently, with mental health support and legal advice, she has made a further claim for asylum with more evidence about her almost unimaginable experiences. She is desperately waiting to hear whether she has been given the refugee status and safety she needs.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Repressive regimes, such as that in the DRC or Saudi Arabia, are never going to set up formal routes for their dissidents to cross borders</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gloria is certainly a vulnerable woman, whose claim for protection is urgent. Should she feel reassured by Priti Patel’s newfound concern for women like her?</p> <p>Let’s look at what will happen to Gloria under this plan. Patel is proposing a two-tier system, which, for the first time, will distinguish between refugees, depending on whether they arrive through formal or informal routes – which she calls illegal routes. Those routes include the way that Gloria was brought here, by traffickers.</p> <p>They may also include the routes taken by many other women I know, who used false papers, temporary visas or hid in the backs of lorries to cross borders. Such as the Saudi woman who ran away from the family that had threatened to kill her for her atheism. Or the Ugandan woman who fled the community where she had suffered punishment rape for being a lesbian. Or the Azerbaijani woman who came hidden in the back of a truck after being persecuted because she was a Christian. Or the director of Women for Refugee Women, <a href=\"https://www.refugeewomen.co.uk/alphonsine-kabagabo/\" title=\"\">Alphonsine Kabagabo</a>, who was taken to safety during the 1994 Rwandan genocide, hidden by Belgian soldiers in an armoured vehicle.</p> <p>All these women have been recognised as refugees. But all had to take any way they could out of their own countries. For all those who come by informal routes now, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/mar/24/how-is-priti-patel-planning-to-change-the-uks-asylum-system\" title=\"\">Patel is proposing</a> to strip away the possibility of permanent leave to remain. So even if she is recognised as a refugee, Gloria will not now be safe from potential deportation. Every two and a half years, she will have to present evidence about why she cannot return to the country she fled. Try to imagine what that could cost her – financially, in terms of legal advice, but also emotionally, when she goes again and again to the authorities to relive her experiences and beg them not to send her back to her torturers.</p> <p>Working with refugees, I’ve found that there is often a wonderful moment when women can at last begin to heal. This never comes immediately. It comes a while after they get leave to remain, when they begin to feel more secure, when they start to rebuild their lives and take tentative steps into a brighter future. Without permanent settlement, this moment will never come.</p> <p>Patel claims that her system is fair because it will be combined with an increase in formal routes to resettlement. These routes do not exist for women such as Gloria and they never will. Repressive regimes, such as that in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/oct/02/drc-protestors-demand-justice-over-unprosecuted-rapes-and-murders\" title=\"\">DRC, well known for its use of sexual violence</a> against female civilians, or Saudi Arabia, where women are not even allowed legal status as independent adults, are never going to set up formal routes for their dissidents to cross borders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/11/saudi-arabia-loujain-al-hathloul-release-sparks-calls-for-real-justice\">Saudi Arabia: Loujain al-Hathloul release sparks calls for 'real justice'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What’s more, the new plan is going to make it even harder for women such as Gloria to be recognised as refugees at all. Patel is proposing to clamp down on further submissions and appeals and make it tougher for individuals to bring extra evidence later on in the asylum process. This flies in the face of everything that we know about how hard it is for women to talk in depth about sexual violence as soon as they escape the perpetrators.</p> <p>And what Priti Patel didn’t tell parliament is that she is also presiding over a potential increase in detention for women. She is currently rushing through plans for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/27/revealed-priti-patel-u-turn-on-end-to-detention-for-refugee-women\" title=\"\">new immigration detention centre for women</a> in the north-east of England, which will be used to lock up more women like Gloria.</p> <p>It is time for Labour to stand up and challenge this government on how these proposals will affect women. The party needs to speak up for those who are not being heard. Because, for those very women who are most in need of protection, these plans will condemn them to further trauma, to detention or even deportation back to countries where their lives are in danger.</p> <p>Where are the vulnerable women? Priti Patel, they are here and you are betraying them.</p> <p><em>• </em><em>Natasha Walter is the founder of the charity Women for Refugee Women</em><em> and the author of </em>Living Dolls: The Return of Sexism</p>",
